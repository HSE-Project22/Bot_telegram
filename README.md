# Telegram Bot

# Why this project exists?

The main reason of creating this project is necessary final project in our course of python. However, we tried to do it really useful for students of HSE, because we ourselves have faced this problem many times. 

This project helps to bachelor and master degrees students to get information about their courses and their duration.

# How to use it?

1) Find our bot in Telegram (@...)

2) Click the button "start" ![197000064-6093cbb6-ab6f-4ebc-bb6d-231a406a074a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115813128/197001118-d89a65b6-aba1-440d-a767-b0b44241a9d9.png)

3) Now you will have an opportunity to choose which degree are you interested in ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115813128/197000527-0f2a71c3-7c1f-4578-8638-8cfeec67eba3.png)

4) After choosing your degree you will see all the programs that you can choose from. Now you need to choose yours by sending a serial number
Example: You are from the program "History and Archeology", so you need to send "8" to the bot. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115813128/197002644-f279b2b2-b7f0-4dd6-8316-15b2099bb3b3.png)

5) This step is very similar to the previous one, you need to choose a sub-program
Example: You are from the program "Archeology", so you need to send "1" to the bot. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115813128/197003819-121c094c-4c07-49a9-a85b-904eebbd9a8a.png)

6) So, now is the final step, where you can see all the courses and their duration ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115813128/197004455-aa39acad-5df6-4dd6-8c2d-96100ac3c79b.png)

# Few important remarks

1) All dependencies for VENV are in file "requirements.txt"

2) The output of the bot depends on the information from HSE website

3) If you want to use our bot with the other @username in telegram, the new bot should be created by @BotFather and toen should be replaced by yours ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115813128/197203150-2cf7d1e4-6461-4533-80e0-de765c2e6100.png)
